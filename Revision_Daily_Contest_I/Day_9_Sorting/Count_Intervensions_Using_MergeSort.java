Count inversions!(Using Merge Sort)
Description

Given an array of n integers. Find its inversion count.

Inversion Count for an array indicates â€“ how far (or close) the array is from being sorted.

If the array is already sorted then inversion count is 0. If the array is sorted in the reverse order that inversion count is the maximum.

Formally speaking, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j


Input
Input Format

First line consists of integer n.

Second line consists of n integers separated by spaces.

Constraints

1 <= n <= 100000


Output
Print count in a single line
